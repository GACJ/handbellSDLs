# handbellSTLs

STLs for 3D printing of dummy handbells that can be used with change ringing simulators.

**Handle v7 is slightly loose in the socket, so v7-2 should fix that, BUT it has not yet been tested**

90mm bell - support is needed for the button shafts and the electronics tunnel.
Handle - support is needed for the overhang at the end of the square section, otherwise it tends to droop
