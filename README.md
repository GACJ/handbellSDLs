# handbellSTLs

STLs for 3D printing of dummy handbells that can be used with change ringing simulators.

**Handle v7 is slightly loose in the socket, v7-2 is better but will still require glue, v7-3 is slightly bigger still, BUT it has not yet been tested (result will be about 2pm ish**

90mm bell - support is needed for the button shafts and the electronics tunnel.

Handle - support is needed for the overhang at the end of the square section, otherwise it tends to droop

The Grommit still need a bit of work, it isn't quite optimised yet - will do this asap.
