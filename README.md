# handbellSTLs

STLs for 3D printing of dummy handbells that can be used with change ringing simulators.

**All uploaded and ready to use**

90mm bell - support is needed for the button shafts and the electronics tunnel; print from same material as 3mm plug and electronics cap.  I currently use: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B082XTFB7T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

Handle - support is needed for the overhang at the end of the square section, otherwise it tends to droop; print from same material as grommit and bell cap.  I use either: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MGKYFFP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 or https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07FQ75QG2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1.
